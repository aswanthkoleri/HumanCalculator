<h1><u>Answer For Question 1</u></h1>
<div class="questionPane" id="1">
  <p id="question"><h2>Answer Is 96<br>
       12 months in a year, 52 weeks in a year, and 365 days in a year
     Let m be my age in years. If s is my son's age in years, then my son is 52s weeks old. If g is my grandson's age in          years, then my grandson is 365g days old. Thus, 

     365g = 52s. 

     Since my grandson is 12g months old, 

     12g = m. 

     Since my grandson, my son and I together are 160 years, 

     g + s + m = 160. 

     The above system of 3 equations in 3 unknowns (g, s and m) can be solved as follows. 

     m / 12 + 365 m / (52 × 12) + m = 160 or 

     52 m + 365 m + 624 m = 624 × 160 or 

     m = 624 × 160 / 1041 = 96. 

     So, I am 96 years old."
