1   :   96

     12 months in a year, 52 weeks in a year, and 365 days in a year
     Let m be my age in years. If s is my son's age in years, then my son is 52s weeks old. If g is my grandson's age in years, then my grandson is 365g days old. Thus, 

     365g = 52s. 

     Since my grandson is 12g months old, 

     12g = m. 

     Since my grandson, my son and I together are 160 years, 

     g + s + m = 160. 

     The above system of 3 equations in 3 unknowns (g, s and m) can be solved as follows. 

     m / 12 + 365 m / (52 × 12) + m = 160 or 

     52 m + 365 m + 624 m = 624 × 160 or 

     m = 624 × 160 / 1041 = 96. 

     So, I am 96 years old."

5   : 225
     All the rectangles on the board can be identified by connecting: 
    2 points of the 6 in the top edge (to form the length of the rectangle) and 
    2 points of the 6 in the left edge (to form the breadth of the rectangle). 

    To gain a better understanding, consider the 8 × 8 chess board (see animation above). 
    Note that there are 4 possibilities for the lengths of the rectangles to be 5 units. 

  
      Length of rectangle	Number of Possibilities
               5 units	1
               4 units	2
               3 units	3
               ...	...
               1 unit	5
    So, number of possibilities for different lengths of rectangles = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 5 = 15. 
    Similarly, number of possibilities for different breadths of rectangles = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 5 = 15. 
    Hence, number of rectangles = 15 × 15 = 225. 

     ThankYou!
